      "Telebirr is a mobile money service developed by Huawei that is owned and was launched by Ethio telecom, the state owned telecommunication and Internet service provider in Ethiopia. It took five months for Huawei to develop the end-to-end service. It facilitates the delivery of cashless transactions. The platform deployed currently has the capacity of processing up to 100 transactions per second (TPS) and can be scaled up to 1000 TPS in the future according to Huawei. The service is accessible via SMS, USSD, and smartphone applications. Telebirr works in five languages.",
      "As a user, I aimed to make some of the steps or flows much easier and more user friendly, and as a UI designer, I made the interface much more attractive and easier to read, and I made it so that it is easier to understand each of the services offered in the telebirr design and that it is more related to Ethiopian culture and modern feeling.",
      "Let's discuss some of the platform's features and services. To start, you can easily create an account, deposit money here from various banks in Ethiopia, and withdraw it as well. You can also see services like loans (SENQ, ENDEKISE, and MELA), each of which has a distinct theme that makes it easy for users to distinguish one service from the others.",
      "Others include the ability for users to easily top up their mobile money and package balances on this platform, pay their house mortgages directly from their homes using this service, and subscribe as volunteers for organizations like the Red Cross, GERD, or other charities they may find appealing.",

      "Business-to-business (B2B), also called B-to-B, is a form of transaction between businesses, such as one involving a manufacturer and wholesaler, or a wholesaler and a retailer. Business-to-business refers to business that is conducted between companies, rather than between a company and individual consumer. Business-to-business stands in contrast to business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-government (B2G) transactions.",
      "Business-to-business (B2B) is a transaction or business conducted between one business and another, such as a wholesaler and retailer. B2B transactions tend to happen in the supply chain, where one company will purchase raw materials from another to be used in the manufacturing process. B2B transactions are also commonplace for auto industry companies, as well as property management, housekeeping, and industrial cleanup companies.",
      "Meanwhile, business-to-consumer transactions (B2C) are those made between a company and individual consumers.",
      "Therefore, based on these definitions, there are three platforms that I created for a client: the Distributer side, the Retailer side, and the driver/delivery side of the program. Each of these has its own unique functionalities, and they are all interconnected through other functionalities.",
      "The distributor side is basically the app that contains the inventory and categories, accepts orders from retailers, and packs the orders before delivering them to the retailers. The driving side will accept a request from the distributor and designate him to deliver it to the person who made the request. And the retailer is the one who requests products from the distributor and receives those items through the distributor's designated delivery for use in his job",

      "The world of online betting is becoming increasingly popular, and mobile applications are making it even more accessible. One such app that has recently gained traction is a quiz-style betting game that rewards users with money if they answer all the questions correctly. This type of application combines two popular activities - gambling and education - into one unique experience. ",
      "When designing a user interface (UI) for this kind of application, there are several factors to consider in order to ensure an enjoyable experience for players. Firstly, the UI should be intuitive and easy to navigate so as not to deter potential customers from playing the game due to confusion or frustration over how it works or looks like on their device screens; secondly, research should be conducted into what types of questions would best engage players while also providing them with an educational benefit; lastly but most importantly – safety measures must be put in place so as not only protect users’ data but also give them peace-of-mind when playing these games online. ",
      "In terms of question selection for this type of app, developers need to choose topics carefully based on market research into what kinds people would find interesting yet challenging enough at the same time whilst still being somewhat educational in nature – science related topics seem particularly suitable here given its popularity amongst many demographics today . Furthermore , since this particular genre requires real money stakes , developers must take extra care ensuring all security protocols are up-to date ; encryption technology can help keep player information safe while payment gateways such as Stripe & PayPal can provide secure transactions between parties involved . ",
      " To sum up , developing a UI design specifically tailored towards quiz style betting apps involves careful consideration regarding both UX/UI elements plus additional features needed including appropriate question selections & robust security measures too . With proper planning & execution however , these types applications have great potentials bringing fun filled experiences combined with learning opportunities together through engaging gameplay mechanics which may appeal greatly within certain markets around today's digital age",

In Ethiopia, a new investment platform has been created that allows investors to invest in startup ideas and businesses while also providing resources for those who have an idea but need funding or patent rights. ",
      "The UI design I created for this platform was designed with simplicity in mind; it's easy-to-use interface allows users to quickly navigate through various sections such as investment options, portfolio management tools, and research materials. All of these features are organized into intuitive menus which allow users to easily find what they’re looking for without having any prior knowledge about investing or business operations. Additionally, all information is presented clearly on each page so that even novice investors can understand how things work quickly and accurately make decisions about their investments accordingly. ",
      "The main goal of this UI design was not only ease-of use but also security; we made sure every user’s data is encrypted at all times by using industry standard encryption algorithms throughout the entire platform - from login pages right down individual transactions - ensuring maximum protection against cyber threats like identity theft or fraudulence activities . We also implemented two factor authentication systems which require both a username & password combination as well as another form of identification (such as fingerprint scanning) before allowing access into user accounts – adding an extra layer safety when handling sensitive financial information online . ",
      " Overall , my team did an excellent job creating a secure yet simple UI design tailored specifically towards helping Ethiopian entrepreneurs get started with their innovative ideas while simultaneously enabling more experienced investor s gain better insights on potential investments opportunities within Ethiopia ‘s growing market landscape",

This idea came to me when I noticed that most individuals, especially in our country of Ethiopia, complete their projects before conducting any research. I strongly disagree with this style of undertaking and completing tasks.\n So i thought of three platforms to be built ways to conduct the researches and i categorize them in three ways they are like the following : ",
      "Data questionnaire \n This part is handled where the main project will be managed since they mostly want to conduct research on the project that they are going to work on. This one will ensure that all questionnaires are legitimate, available to everyone who will be questioned, and each and every question will have a standard.",
      "This person will be able to input a question in any language they desire, set a measurement, select an item category, and then finally edit, publish, or remove the questions. This provides them complete flexibility while they are creating questionnaires.\n After the questionnaires have been approved and listed with the names, dates, and other statuses of the questions, they will be published.",
      "Mobile-based data collection: \n This will make it easy for other project team members to meet with people, ask them all the questions that have been published, manage their responses, and ask questions in numerous locations because it is a mobile platform. This will lead to better research results.",
      "They can sign up for this smartphone app, and it will list the data collection forms from the organizations with names of the current month and date, items of collected data, and questionnaires. This allows them to sync with the server, and they can then submit the data after validating and submitting the responses for each questionnaire.",
      "Web-based report: \nViewing the data using the information provided here and the following information, such as possible price Inflation expectations and other measurement values\nThere are then filters and historical data by region, time, range, and other filters, followed by charts, graphs, and maybe maps, and finally monthly reports for the research's published data.",

For ELMIS specifically, UI design helps ensure that users are able to quickly find what they need within this complex database of information about jobs and wages across different sectors within Ethiopia’s economy. ",
      " To make sure it meets user needs effectively, ILO has conducted extensive research into how best to structure its interface so as not only provide easy navigation but also display all necessary details clearly without being too cluttered or overwhelming for users unfamiliar with using such databases before hand . As part of this process , ILO has identified key elements which should be included when designing a successful user interface for ELMIS including; clear menus , search filters , visualisations & graphs as well as intuitively organised content . Additionally , usability testing was conducted among target audiences from various backgrounds prior launching the final product ensuring their feedback & insights were taken into account during development stages . ",

      "Ethiopia is located in the Horn of Africa, bordering Sudan, South Sudan, Kenya, Somalia, Eritrea and Djibouti. The country has the second biggest population in Africa, with over 50% of people being under 25 years of age.1 Due to the vast size of the population, it is important to recognise that descriptions of Ethiopian cultural customs can vary significantly. There are many distinct cultural practices that are specific to people’s region, ethnicity or religion. Despite this diversity, Ethiopians are generally united by their patriotism and pride in the country’s overarching cultural identity.",
      "Ethiopia is the oldest independent country in Africa, once ruled as a dynasty by a series of monarchs. It is distinct from most other African nations as it is one of the only countries that successfully resisted European colonization. It also has a historical connection to Christianity, with the region adopting the religion before many Western nations were exposed to it. This legacy of the country’s independence and the Ethiopian ‘Tewahedo’ Orthodox Church are very important to Ethiopians’ sense of national pride. Their sense of morality and cultural refinement are shaped by centuries of practice, and continue to inform how they see themselves in the contemporary setting. Generally speaking, Ethiopians are renowned for being welcoming, considerate, cooperative and non-confrontational people.      ",
      "Since I've lived here my entire life, I just wanted to represent my country and give Ethiopian identity to most of the things I do. For example, as you can see, this is the user authentication side for the X-Ethiopia conceptual design. above that, you can see the buildings and monuments in Ethiopia that are immediately recognizable to anyone who sees them, and for those who don't, they will gain a general understanding of Ethiopian culture.      ",

      "Addis Ababa’s parking system is mainly dominated by on-street parking, although there are a few off-street parking areas or parking spaces inside buildings. However, there are no readily accessible parking areas near public transport terminals, which contribute to the inefficient utilization of the road network, especially in terms of road users’ safety and traffic congestion. This, in turn, contributes to higher carbon emissions from vehicles and further impacts on air quality. Addis Ababa’s Transport Programs Management Office (TPMO) is making efforts to solve parking issues through the development of optimized parking systems, particularly with the construction of smart parking systems equipped with modern devices, such as cameras and sensors.",

A UI designer needs to consider the audience, target market, content, and features when designing the website's hero page. In this blog post we'll discuss some of the best practices for creating a great UI design on a wedding website hero page. ",
      "First off, it’s important to understand who your audience is so that you can tailor your design accordingly. Are you targeting couples planning their own weddings or those attending someone else’s? Knowing this information will help inform decisions such as which types of images should be featured on the homepage and what language should be used in copywriting elements like headlines or calls-to-action (CTAs). ",
      "Research plays an essential role in successful web design projects – especially when it comes to crafting effective UIs for websites with specific audiences like weddings sites have. It’s important to research similar websites within your industry so that you can get inspired by what works well from them while avoiding any potential pitfalls they may have encountered along their journey into success! Additionally researching competitors gives insight into how other businesses are marketing themselves towards customers who are looking for services related yours - giving ideas about how different aspects could potentially look better than before!  ",
      "The next step involves understanding exactly what type of content needs highlighting on the homepage; photos from real weddings create instant engagement since people tend relate more easily with visuals rather than text alone - showcasing happy couples tying knot helps set tone & feel desired atmosphere right away! Other elements such as video clips featuring testimonials also work wonders because they give potential customers glimpse at kind service provided through first person accounts instead just relying solely upon written descriptions given by company itself – further helping build trustworthiness reputation site has amongst its visitors too!. Finally don't forget include clear CTAs throughout entire webpage ensure viewers know exactly how take action if interested any offerings presented thereupon ensuring maximum conversions possible each visit made!.",

They can also easily find out where the buses are beginning and ending as well as all the intermediate bus stops. They can easily rate the driver, either by complimenting them or by criticizing them if they feel they are not doing a good job. Finally, the most important step is purchasing a ticket. This might be a daily ticket, a package for a week or a month, or a monthly ticket with a discount , and those tickets are scanned by the driver when they enter the bus",
      "Anbessa bus Driver: The bus driver has fewer functionalities than the passengers. He will only log in with his account and if he is assigned a path or road (in our case, the bus number), he will insert that number and start his journey.  The bus driver can read the qr code tickets that the passengers purchased and allow them to board the bus. He can also print manual tickets for those who do not have access to smartphones, which are quite common in our country, and print them for them.",

The UI allows users not only view this data but also filter it based on various criteria such as location or profession type so they can more easily find what they’re looking for without having to scroll through pages upon pages of results manually. Additionally, the dashboard provides visualizations that allow employers quickly assess labor trends over time which makes it easier for them plan their staffing needs accordingly.  ",
      " In order maximize usability and effectiveness , designers have taken great care when designing LMIS's UI by incorporating best design principles such as simplicity , clarity , consistency & responsiveness . For example: simple navigation structure enables users navigate between sections easily; clear labels & icons provide quick understanding ; consistent layout ensures no confusion while browsing; responsive design adapts well different device sizes making sure all content is visible regardless size screen used . All these features together create an enjoyable experience while using platform enabling people use effectively & efficiently without getting frustrated due lack usability issues common many other platforms out there today ",

Whether you’re looking for clothing, furniture, electronics, or something else entirely – there’s likely a rental app that can help you out. But before launching any such application it is important to understand the user interface (UI) design and research involved in creating an intuitive experience for users. ",
      "The first step in UI design is understanding who your target audience is and what their needs are when using the application. This includes researching competitors within this space as well as conducting surveys with potential customers to get feedback on current designs or features they would like included in the product itself. Once this information has been gathered it can be used to create wireframes which outline how each page should look and function within the app itself - including buttons/icons placement & sizes along with other visual elements such as colors & fonts used throughout its pages/screens etc.. Additionally usability testing should also be conducted at various stages during development process so that any issues found by real users can be addressed quickly before launch date arrives! ",
      "The next step involves researching different types of accessories available through rental apps; from clothes & furniture pieces all way up till electronic gadgets like laptops/TVs etc.. It's important here too understand what kind of items people would want access most frequently since these will need special attention when designing product features related them (like sorting options based on category). Additionally pricing structures should also researched thoroughly so that customers have access competitively priced rentals while still making sure company makes enough profit off each transaction!",
      "Finally after all necessary data has been collected , developers then have task creating actual UI layout which takes into account both customer feedback UX best practices . This means incorporating things like clear navigation menus , logical hierarchy between pages / screens plus ensuring overall aesthetic remains consistent across entire platform ! By following these steps one can ensure their mobile renting application provides great user experience right away upon launch day - allowing everyone enjoy convenience offered by technology today without ever having worry about complicated setup processes getting lost among hundreds other similar products market !",

One such application is Ethiomart, an ecommerce platform designed specifically for Ethiopian customers. With this app, users can easily shop online from a variety of local businesses in Ethiopia and have their purchases delivered directly to their doorstep. ",
      "The UI design of Ethiomart was developed with both user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) research in mind. The team conducted extensive market research into what people wanted from an e-commerce experience before designing the look and feel of the app itself. This included understanding how Ethiopians use digital devices like smartphones as well as researching customer preferences when it comes to shopping online versus offline experiences within Ethiopia’s cultural context. As a result, they created an intuitive interface that makes it easy for users to navigate through different product categories quickly while also providing helpful information about each item listed on the platform such as price comparisons or reviews written by other shoppers who have purchased similar products before them – all which helps make informed decisions easier than ever before! ",
      "Additionally, Ethiomart also offers secure payment options via credit/debit cards or cash on delivery services so customers can be sure that their transactions are safe at all times even when purchasing items over long distances across countries without having accesses traditional banking systems like ATMs etc… All these features combined create a seamless shopping experience tailored towards Ethiopian needs making ethioMart one of its kind!",

      "Graphic design is an integral part of any successful social media post. Whether you’re promoting a product, service or event, your visuals need to be on point in order to capture the attention of potential customers and followers. For example, if you are trying to promote Tevise watches from different brands and themes then it’s important that your graphic design stands out amongst the competition. ",

      " The first thing you should do when designing graphics for a Tevise watch promotion is decide what kind of visual style best suits the brand and theme being promoted. Is it modern? Vintage? Minimalist? Once this has been established then all other elements can be designed with this style in mind such as colors, fonts and imagery used within the post itself. Additionally think about how these elements work together - does one particular color stand out more than others or does everything blend together nicely? ",

      " Once all these aspects have been considered its time for some creative thinking! Think outside-the-box when creating graphics for social media posts – use unique shapes (like circles instead of squares) or add animation effects like parallax scrolling which can help draw people into your content even further! You could also consider adding interactive features such as quizzes or polls which would make engaging with users much easier while giving them something interesting to interact with too!  ",

      " Finally don’t forget about typography – using bold typefaces will ensure that key words/phrases are highlighted so they stand out from other text on screen whilst still keeping things looking neat & tidy overall; plus try experimenting by combining different font styles together too create eye catching headlines etc...  All these little touches will give viewers something extra special helping them remember who they saw those awesome designs from: YOU!!",

The platform deployed currently has the capacity of processing up to 100 transactions per second (TPS) and can be scaled up to 1000 TPS in the future according to Huawei. The service is accessible via SMS, USSD, and smartphone applications. Telebirr works in five languages.",
      "As a user, I aimed to make some of the steps or flows much easier and more user friendly, and as a UI designer, I made the interface much more attractive and easier to read, and I made it so that it is easier to understand each of the services offered in the telebirr design and that it is more related to Ethiopian culture and modern feeling.",
      "Let's discuss some of the platform's features and services. To start, you can easily create an account, deposit money here from various banks in Ethiopia, and withdraw it as well. You can also see services like loans (SENQ, ENDEKISE, and MELA), each of which has a distinct theme that makes it easy for users to distinguish one service from the others.",
      "Others include the ability for users to easily top up their mobile money and package balances on this platform, pay their house mortgages directly from their homes using this service, and subscribe as volunteers for organizations like the Red Cross, GERD, or other charities they may find appealing.",
